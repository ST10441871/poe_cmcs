For the CMCS the GUI system should be able to capture the details of the lectures / independent contractors claims without any issues of creating repeated/ redundant databases. Once the IC has put in their information the system should be able to store their information into a database without the need to re-enter said information. 
As soon as the claims have been entered, the ability to calculate the hours worked should be implemented, this makes it easier for them to browse through the GUI.
The core data structure is defined within the C# Model classes (Lecturer, Claim, SupportingDocument). These classes act as blueprints, representing the essential entities in the system's database and forming the basis for the required UML diagram. Key attributes like HoursWorked, HourlyRate, and Status are defined using Data Annotations (e.g., [Required], [EmailAddress]), which serve a dual purpose: they clearly document validation rules and will automatically enforce them in the functional version of the application. The virtual keyword on navigation properties (e.g., Lecturer.Claims) enables Entity Framework's lazy loading, a crucial performance feature for efficiently retrieving related data from the database on demand.

The user interface is constructed using the HTML View (Claims.cshtml). This Razor view is strongly typed to the Claim model, meaning its form fields are directly linked to the model's properties. The asp-for Tag Helpers generate the id and name attributes for these form elements, ensuring that when the form is submitted in a future version, the data will be perfectly structured for the server to receive and process into a Claim object. The form includes a non-functional file upload input, visually fulfilling the requirement for document submission.

The C# Controller (ClaimClass.cs) acts as the intermediary, orchestrating the flow between the user's request (View) and the data (Model). Its Create() actions are currently stubs. The GET action simply delivers the empty form to the user's browser. The POST action, which will eventually handle form submission, currently contains a placeholder redirect, explicitly meeting the Part 1 requirement for a non-functional prototype. In subsequent development, this action will contain the logic to validate the incoming model data, perform calculations (e.g., TotalAmount = HoursWorked * HourlyRate), save the claim to a database, and manage file uploads.
